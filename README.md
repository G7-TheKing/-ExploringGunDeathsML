# Exploring Gun Deaths in the USA
This was a Dataquest Guided Project on Exploring Gun Deaths in The USA. No fancy frameworks
have been used. CSV file readers and basic for loops have proved sufficient in inferring a
lot of statistical data. Good starter project for those interested in Data Science.
